  "body": "# Udacity_Project_03 : It is based on **Stock Hawk** Project of **Android Developer Nanodegree Program**.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**## Project Overview**\r\nYou will productionize an app, taking it from a functional state to a production-ready state. This will involve finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.\r\n\r\n**## Why this Project?**\r\nStock Hawk gives you an opportunity to diagnose problems and practice improving apps. These skills are vital to building apps users will love.\r\n\r\nDiagnosing issues with existing apps is key to working on large apps or continuing projects in Android. Being aware of the common pitfalls in app design frees a developer to produce novel app experiences without making the same mistakes over and over.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**## What Will I Learn?**\r\n\r\n_In this Project , we have done :_<br>\r\n\r\n* Diagnose existing issues with an app.<br>\r\n* Make an app accessible to sight-impaired users.<br>\r\n* Allow your app to be localized for distribution in other countries.<br>\r\n* Handle error cases in Android.<br>\r\n* Add a widget to your app experience.<br>\r\n* Leverage the functionality of a library in your app.<br>\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**## Project Rubric :**\r\nEach stock quote on the main screen is clickable and leads to a new screen which graphs the stock's value over time.\r\n\r\nStock Hawk does not crash when a user searches for a non-existent stock.\r\n\r\nStock Hawk Stocks can be displayed in a collection widget.\r\n\r\nStock Hawk app has content descriptions for all buttons.\r\n\r\nStock Hawk app supports layout mirroring using both the RTL attribute and the start/end tags.\r\n\r\nStrings are all included in the strings.xml file and untranslatable strings have a translatable tag marked to false.",
