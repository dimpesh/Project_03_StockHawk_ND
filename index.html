<p><strong>## Project Overview</strong>
You will productionize an app, taking it from a functional state to a production-ready state. This will involve finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.</p>

<p><strong>## Why this Project?</strong>
Stock Hawk gives you an opportunity to diagnose problems and practice improving apps. These skills are vital to building apps users will love.</p>

<p>Diagnosing issues with existing apps is key to working on large apps or continuing projects in Android. Being aware of the common pitfalls in app design frees a developer to produce novel app experiences without making the same mistakes over and over.</p>
