# Udacity_Project_03 : It is based on **Stock Hawk** Project of **Android Developer Nanodegree Program**.

***

**## Project Overview**
You will productionize an app, taking it from a functional state to a production-ready state. This will involve finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.

**## Why this Project?**
Stock Hawk gives you an opportunity to diagnose problems and practice improving apps. These skills are vital to building apps users will love.

Diagnosing issues with existing apps is key to working on large apps or continuing projects in Android. Being aware of the common pitfalls in app design frees a developer to produce novel app experiences without making the same mistakes over and over.
